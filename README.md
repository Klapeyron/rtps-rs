# The Real-time Publish-Subscribe Protocol for Rust

This is the implementation of the Real-time Publish-Subscribe Protocol (RTPS) DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol for Rust.

The Data Distribution Service for real-time systems (DDS) is an Object Management Group (OMG) machine-to-machine connectivity framework that aims to enable scalable, real-time, dependable, high-performance and interoperable data exchanges using a publishâ€“subscribe pattern. DDS addresses the needs of applications like air-traffic control, smart grid management, autonomous vehicles, robotics, transportation systems, power generation, medical devices, simulation and testing, aerospace and defense, and other applications that require real-time data exchange [[Wiki]][wiki-dds-url].

### Features
The objectives of this implementation are:
* Implementing RTPS according to specification [[RTPS-2.2]][omg-rtps-url]
* Integrating into the Rust-Tokio event system for async IO.
* Feature X
* Feature Y
...
TBD

### Roadmap
* Version 0.1 Feature X, Feature Y
* Version 0.2: Feature Z
